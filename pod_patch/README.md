## Description

This is a fairly simple 8 step sequencer generator which has 2 jobs:-

1. Generate a gate signal for each active step in the sequence (sent to the left channel)
2. Generate an audio signal based on the frequency for the intervals in a diatonic scale using the knob2 (sent to the right channel)

The output is sent to a patch.init module
